# wgui
This had to be done.  It's a simple, terrible, unsafe, messy, quickly-done, frontend for Wireguard on Linux.  It uses Python3/Tkinter

# prerequisites
- Linux / systemd
- Wireguard / wg-quick
- Existing /etc/wireguard directory
- Python 3 / tkinter

# notes
There is a test0.conf file to test the import option.
